                        <p>
                         I left JCU that morning to the Cleveland Airport. It was a smooth Lyft ride to the airport.
                         My flight was at 730am and I arrived at the airport aound 610am. There was a long line of people
                         checking in and was a bit worried I might miss my flight for the first time ever.
                         It was by mere chance was able to cut in the line...a few other people did the same.
                        </p><br>
                        <p>
                        Then security check...boarding and finally was in the plane. I had two things I needed to do while on the plane
                        that morning. First, was finishing up writing a tribute to a friend, Wongani, who had passed a week ago. I wrote it in  notes app in
                        my new Pixel 3a phone and the plan was as soon as I got off the plane I would share it in the Slack group of my high school. The plan followed through.
                        
                        
                        In the plane, I also finished seting up my new e-portfolio (hondohondo.com) and I committed and pushed the repository to
                        Github when I got off the plane.
                    </p></br>
                        <p>
                            At LA Airport, Will Holmes was waiting to pick me up. I also met two other members, Ethan from Cincinatti and Kalman from Houston.
                            Our ride to Independence where our base camp is located bagan, we passed by In & Out Burger for lunch (Such a beautiful, clean and unsophisticated chain).
                           </p><br>
                        <p>
                        We arrived at the house at Independence, met Tom and I surrendered all my electronics (phone and laptop). Then around 330pm we headed to the Base Camp.
                        Will dropped us at a junction where I met Liam, our camp leader. The whole scene was splendid - quite, sunny and a lot of beautiful landscape and mountains.
                        We arrived at the Base Camp, I met Aaron for the first time and then Peter and Dhilon whom I had already met.
                        We sat down and got to know each other, the 7 of us. It was 4pm.
                        </p><br>
                        <p>
                        Dinner was to be prepared by 630pm. I went for shower up the hill, came back and just observed the dinner preparation, took a few
                        pictures etc.
                        Aaron (18) from Ireland, a quartermaster, prepared salad (carrots, lettuce, onions & cherry tomatoes). We had crackers
                        and salsa as appetizers, then salad and corn and hot dogs as the main meal.
                        </p><br>
                        <p>
                        Base camp was pretty basic - just a tent for the shade in the afternoon and a cooking place made of dessert rocks plus a few other supplies.
                        After dinner, which was around 8pm, we did some cleaning of the utensils then I went to bed at 945pm. Day 1 was over!

                        <p>
                            Woke up at 5am, read part of Euthyphro (from Plato's Dialogues) till 6am went to be again and woke up at 630am
                            We folded our sleeping bags and covered them up with tarps (tarpaulin) then we headed for breakfast prepared by Ethan.
                            Breakfast today was Beacon, Eggs, Orange juice, Milk and Cereals.
                        </p><br>
                        <p>
                            Filled up the water bags (the ones we used for showering) with Dillon and gathered up our things ready for inspection by Will. 
                            (Will was checking all our stuff to see if we have got the right gear for hiking).
                            The stuff were checked and I needed a rain gear and closed-toe sandals. Will provided a rain pant later that day.
                        </p><br>
                        <p>
                            We then gathered for a short briefing under a creek. Liam went over the housekeeping stuff and safety issues. Later
                            we had lunch which was leftovers from past dinner and fresh fruits. At 1230, we went for a short 90min hike to the waterfall.
                        </p><br>
                        <p>
                            The start for me was a bit tough, I was breathing heavily as I was climbing those hills. I was told we were about 5000 to 6000 feet above the ground
                            but only about 300 feet above the base camp.
                            It was a bit risk going over rocks and steep parts of the mountain - but I made it to the waterfall.
                            I took a few pictures by the waterfall (Of course you gonna see them), sat down for about 30 minutes, then we started going back to the base camp at
                            about 3pm
                        </p><br>
                        <p>
                            At the base camp I was told to help Ethan cook at 5pm. When it was about time, we began cooking. I made salad, cooked ham steak and Ethan made pasta.
                            After the meal, there was some cleaning then we sat down and start discussing about the next day.
                        </p><br>
                        <p>
                            It's 930pm, after some talk by the fire with Tom, Will, Ethan, Peter and Liam I decided to go to bed.
                        </p>

                            Shows you how jQuery can more and more be replaced with simple, vanilla JavaScript. Back in the day jQuery was extremely helpful, but JavaScript has been catching up. Even if you don't use jQuery, this resource is handy to check out how some common tasks
                            are done in JavaScript.
