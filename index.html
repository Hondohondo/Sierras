                        <p>
                         I left JCU that morning to the Cleveland Airport. It was a smooth Lyft ride to the airport.
                         My flight was at 730am and I arrived at the airport aound 610am. There was a long line of people
                         checking in and was a bit worried I might miss my flight for the first time ever.
                         It was by mere chance was able to cut in the line...a few other people did the same.
                        </p><br>
                        <p>
                        Then security check...boarding and finally was in the plane. I had two things I needed to do while on the plane
                        that morning. First, was finishing up writing a tribute to a friend, Wongani, who had passed a week ago. I wrote it in  notes app in
                        my new Pixel 3a phone and the plan was as soon as I got off the plane I would share it in the Slack group of my high school. The plan followed through.
                        
                        
                        In the plane, I also finished seting up my new e-portfolio (hondohondo.com) and I committed and pushed the repository to
                        Github when I got off the plane.
                    </p></br>
                        <p>
                            At LA Airport, Will Holmes was waiting to pick me up. I also met two other members, Ethan from Cincinatti and Kalman from Houston.
                            Our ride to Independence where our base camp is located bagan, we passed by In & Out Burger for lunch (Such a beautiful, clean and unsophisticated chain).
                           </p><br>
                        <p>
                        We arrived at the house at Independence, met Tom and I surrendered all my electronics (phone and laptop). Then around 330pm we headed to the Base Camp.
                        Will dropped us at a junction where I met Liam, our camp leader. The whole scene was splendid - quite, sunny and a lot of beautiful landscape and mountains.
                        We arrived at the Base Camp, I met Aaron for the first time and then Peter and Dhilon whom I had already met.
                        We sat down and got to know each other, the 7 of us. It was 4pm.
                        </p><br>
                        <p>
                        Dinner was to be prepared by 630pm. I went for shower up the hill, came back and just observed the dinner preparation, took a few
                        pictures etc.
                        Aaron (18) from Ireland, a quartermaster, prepared salad (carrots, lettuce, onions & cherry tomatoes). We had crackers
                        and salsa as appetizers, then salad and corn and hot dogs as the main meal.
                        </p><br>
                        <p>
                        Base camp was pretty basic - just a tent for the shade in the afternoon and a cooking place made of dessert rocks plus a few other supplies.
                        After dinner, which was around 8pm, we did some cleaning of the utensils then I went to bed at 945pm. Day 1 was over!

                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Woke up at 5am, read part of Euthyphro (from Plato's Dialogues) till 6am went to be again and woke up at 630am
                            We folded our sleeping bags and covered them up with tarps (tarpaulin) then we headed for breakfast prepared by Ethan.
                            Breakfast today was Beacon, Eggs, Orange juice, Milk and Cereals.
                        </p><br>
                        <p>
                            Filled up the water bags (the ones we used for showering) with Dillon and gathered up our things ready for inspection by Will. 
                            (Will was checking all our stuff to see if we have got the right gear for hiking).
                            The stuff were checked and I needed a rain gear and closed-toe sandals. Will provided a rain pant later that day.
                        </p><br>
                        <p>
                            We then gathered for a short briefing under a creek. Liam went over the housekeeping stuff and safety issues. Later
                            we had lunch which was leftovers from past dinner and fresh fruits. At 1230, we went for a short 90min hike to the waterfall.
                        </p><br>
                        <p>
                            The start for me was a bit tough, I was breathing heavily as I was climbing those hills. I was told we were about 5000 to 6000 feet above the ground
                            but only about 300 feet above the base camp.
                            It was a bit risk going over rocks and steep parts of the mountain - but I made it to the waterfall.
                            I took a few pictures by the waterfall (Of course you gonna see them), sat down for about 30 minutes, then we started going back to the base camp at
                            about 3pm
                        </p><br>
                        <p>
                            At the base camp I was told to help Ethan cook at 5pm. When it was about time, we began cooking. I made salad, cooked ham steak and Ethan made pasta.
                            After the meal, there was some cleaning then we sat down and start discussing about the next day.
                        </p><br>
                        <p>
                            It's 930pm, after some talk by the fire with Tom, Will, Ethan, Peter and Liam I decided to go to bed.
                        </p>

                            The day began at 4:40am, Dhilon and I were the KPs (Kitchen Patrols) for the day. We prepared breakfast
                            which was eggs (scambled) plus ham steak left overs. Orange juice, fruits and milk was also part of the breakfast. 
                            Breakfast was to be served at 5:50am, then we left for the Sierras about 3000 feet above our base camp (6000 feet)
                        </p><br>
                        <p>
                            Kelvin and Michelle were our tour guides, they're from the Sierra Mountains Authority. They gave us a few instruction, then the rock climbing lessons began. 
                            Because of my height phobia, I struggled to go all the way to the most steep parts of the mountain. So when the rest of the group
                            chose to go even further, I decided to remain about 10 meters below them.
                        </p><br>
                        <p>
                            It was a beautiful experience to be way up in the mountains and have a beautiful view of the whole area. For that day, we were at he Onion Valley
                            which I believe is part of the Sequoia National Park. The hike with Kelvin and Michelle took about 7 hours with a few breaks in between.
                            We began around 8:30am and finished at about 3pm
                        </p><br>
                        <p>
                            It was at the time when I was forcing myself and also being forced to keep on climbing the high steeps that I started thinking
                            maybe this whole rock/mountain climbing was not for me. I began contemplating about how short my days at the camp might end up to be.
                        </p><br>
                        <p>
                            Later that evening after preparing dinner I had a chat with Tom, Will and Liam. I told them that I dont do good with
                            heights and I would prefer to do something else at the camp. They tried to convince me on why I should do it...I said okay...I Will
                            give it a short next day when the group was going for snow school up in the mountains.
                        </p><br>
                        <p>
                            It's to be noted that I have some fear of heights especially when I look down and see steep slopes or exposures. But as far as 
                            elevation and altitude are concerned, am fine with them, provided that I dont deal with high exposures or steep slopes.

                            We began around 8:30am and finished at about 3pm

                            It was at the time when I was forcing myself and also being forced to keep on climbing the high steeps that I started thinking
                            maybe this whole rock/mountain climbing was not for me. I began contemplating about how short my days at the camp might end up to be.

                        <p>
                            Later that evening after preparing dinner I had a chat with Tom, Will and Liam. I told them that I dont do good with
                            heights and I would prefer to do something else at the camp. They tried to convince me on why I should do it...I said okay...I Will
                            give it a short next day when the group was going for snow school up in the mountains.

                        <p>
                            It's to be noted that I have some fear of heights especially when I look down and see steep slopes or exposures. But as far as 
                            elevation and altitude are concerned, am fine with them, provided that I dont deal with high exposures or steep slopes.
